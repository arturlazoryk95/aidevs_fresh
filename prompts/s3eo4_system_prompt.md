# Incorrect: 
To find the city where Barbara is located, let's start exploring the connections through other individuals related to the situation.

Based on the knowledge provided, there are some key individuals and cities that might provide clues. We've had hints of connections through Aleksander Ragowski and Rafał Bomba.

Since Aleksander has been linked to Krakow, Lublin, and Warszawa, and Rafał is suspected to be connected with a resistance movement and possibly related to the incident in Warszawa, they are good starting points. We'll attempt to locate Rafał's current city to uncover more relationships.

Let's ask about Rafał's location.

<people>RAFAL</people>

# Correct:
<people>RAFAL</people>
